Repo for assignment submissions
I have worked on assignment 1 by myself 

List of collaborators: none
Instructions for running the submitted code: i worked on it in VS Code 
Notes on any difficulties encountered: Since I am new to actively using Github, it has taken me sometime to understand what the different terms mean on here but i am getting the hang of it. As far as coding in python goes, I had only worked on R and stata prior to this course so while it did take sometime to do this exercise, i was able to relate it with R programming and have gotten faster at understanding what the question wants. Exercism has been a big help and I am going to continue to use it so that my basics of python are strong. Thank you for all your help and for teaching this course! Have a good day! :)
